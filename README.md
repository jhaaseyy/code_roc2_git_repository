## Getting Started

### First Time Git Users
1. Open Terminal and Install Git
```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
2. Create Git user profile
```
$ git config --global user.name "yourusername"
$ git config --global user.email "user@gmail.com"
```
3. Head to the file directory you want the Git files to be downloaded to
```
$ cd /directory/folder
```
4. Clone the Github Repository into the folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jhaaseyy/code_roc2_git_repository.git
```
5. Now you have a complete copy of the ROC2 repository on your local machine


### Typical Workflow



Download a copy of the folders here, including the makefile into your linux computer. We recommend placing this at the root directory.
```
$ cd /
```
Go to the make folder and compile using make
```
$ cd /root/roc/roc
$ make
```
## Creating a new branch
Click on "clone or download" button then copy the https: link
Put the code in a test folder on your local computer, call it temp
```
$ cd temp
$ git clone https://github.com/jhaaseyy/code_roc2_git_repository.git
```
